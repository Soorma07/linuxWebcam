 *  Description:    This class file was created in hope that it would be easier to capture webcamera data in linux.
 *                  It is heavily based on the capture.c example provided by video4linux.  The capture.c code was
 *                  encapsulated into a C++ class file.
 *
 *                  To use this, simply inherit from the linuxWebcam class and override the processImage(imageData * img)
 *                  method.  See example.cpp
 *
 *                  I have only tested this on my plug-n-play Creative Live! Cam Chat HD Hi-Speed USB.
 *                  Testing on other cameras would be nice.
